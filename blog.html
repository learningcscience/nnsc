            <h3>We are the Nepal best Organization</h3>
           <p>A huge thank you to Leo Club of Kathmandu Regency and Lion Purna Chand for your support of food and stationary materials to NNSC! We are very appreciative of your contribution and for the virtual handover ceremony definitely was a new experience! Also, a very happy birthday to Pranit Chand Thakuri, Rashik Chand and Suruchi from the Leo Regency team! Cheers to the exemplary work you do!!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Food is one of the simplest joys of life - and the most important source. Food sustains us and so we at NNSC have made it an absolute priority to ensure that our children are getting nutritious and healthy meals during their school meals. Since the past 2 years, Himalaya Friends has helped us realize this goal through their donations and for that, we are forever grateful. Thank you for your commitment to help our children and for bringing a smile to their faces every lunch break!!!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Padma Om has been a source of continuous help and support to NNSC since the last five years and we have no words to express how invaluable your donations have been to us and our children. Your contribution of cooking gas has enabled us to provide healthy, well cooked food to our children without any worries. This winter too, our children are getting warm meals amidst the cold with your aid. Additionally, our children truly enjoyed your donation of a month’s worth of chicken for their meals! Thank you for all that you’ve done and continue to do for us!</p>
            <br>
            <p>We express our heartfelt gratitude to all our donors and supporters - you are our rock and what keeps us going! We are very grateful that through your generous help, we were able to nurture our children through this difficult year and keep them safe, sound and healthy and we sincerely hope to be able to do the same many years from now. </p>

            <h3>Magic Class</h3>
            <p>Although magicians don't need to complete any formal education, they do need to learn the tricks of the trade and develop their showmanship skills. Two types of programs are available to learn the magical arts: continuing education courses at a college and training through a professional magicians' organization.A few of the top magic lessons on the platform include Magic Masterclass for Card Tricks and Magic Tricks, Learn Professional Magic Tricks & Card Tricks in 7 Day, Card Magic - Kickstart Card Magic Course, The Magic Pose.</p>

            <h3>Best Taekwondo Class</h3>
            <p>Just think about it, Taekwondo involves repeating stances and fighting patterns, striking the air, training with people in the form of sparring, kicking a bag, doing various cardiovascular and bodyweight exercises and much more.In general, most children should be ready to begin First Tae Kwon Do training from the age of five years. For younger children, we recommend introductory gymnastics training as an excellent foundation on which to build First Tae Kwon Do training.</p>

            <h3>Drama Class</h3>
            <p>We are so proud to see the growth and character development of our children since we started theater class for children at NNSC three months earlier. Some children have really caught the base of theatre and the others are learning too. Initially eldest children were enrolled for the class. They have now reached the point where they can perform a real drama on stage. </p>
